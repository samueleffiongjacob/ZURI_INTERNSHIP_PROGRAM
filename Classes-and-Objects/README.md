> Name: A string, should be initialized when creating an instance of Student  
> Age: An integer, should be initialized when creating an instance of Student  
> Tracks: A list of strings, should be initialized when creating an instance of Student. Feel free to pick any values as tracks.  
> Score: A float, should be initialized when creating an instance of Student.  

1i. Create the following methods for class “Student”:

> change_name: Change students name, should accept a new name as an argument.  
> hange_age: Change students' age, should accept a new age as an argument. Should ensure age remains an integer.  
> Add_track: Add a new item to students tracks, should accept a new track as an argument.
