 COUNTING FUNCTIONS IN  IN TXT FILE

1. Open “main.py”, and complete the function “read_file_content”. It should accept a filename as
an argument and read the text contained in that file. It should return a string.

2. Complete the function “count_words”. It uses “read_file_content” to read the text contained in
“story.txt”. It should return a dictionary whose keys are unique words, and their values the count of those
words in the text e.g {“as”:10, “would”:5}.
